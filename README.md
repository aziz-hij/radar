# Technical Radar

is all about tracking our technology used or interesting things, which we refer to as **blips**. We organize the blips onto the Radar using two categorizing elements: the **quadrants** and the **rings**. The quadrants represent different kinds of blips. The rings indicate what stage in the adoption lifecycle we think they should be in.

# The quadrants is categorized by :

**Programming Languages and Frameworks**. Like the name, this was just languages.
**Tools**. These can be components, such as databases, software development tools, such as versions control systems or more generic categories of tools.
**Platforms**. Things that we build software on top of such as mobile technologies like Android, virtual platforms like the JVM, or generic kinds of platforms like hybrid clouds.
**Techniques**. These include elements of a software development process, such as experience design; and ways of structuring software, such as microservices.

# Our Radar has four rings, which is :

The **Adopt** ring represents blips that we think you should seriously consider using. We don't say that you should use these for every project; any tool should only be used in an appropriate context. However we do think that a blip in the Adopt ring represents something where there's no doubt that it's proven and mature for use.
The **Trial** ring is for blips that we think are ready for use, but not as completely proven as those in the Adopt ring. So for most organizations we think you should use these on a trial basis, to decide whether they should be part of your toolkit.
The **Assess** ring are things to look at closely, but not necessarily trial yet - unless you think they would be a particularly good fit for you. Typically, blips in the Assess ring are things that we think are interesting and worth keeping an eye on.
The **Hold** ring is for things that, even though they are accepted in the industry, we haven't had a good experience with. Therefore we are calling them out to warn you that you may run into trouble with them as well. Sometimes it means we think they're irredeemably flawed; or just being misused. We do place things in the Hold ring that we wish the industry wouldn't use.
 
Unlike the quadrants, we do have some quite passionate arguments about which ring a blip should go into. We don't tend to have angry arguments, but rings are what generate the most energetic discussions. Over the course of making the Radar we've come up with some useful rules of thumb to help us put things into rings.

We can only put blips into the Trial ring when we have experience of that blip on a real project. This can mean we sometimes look behind the technology curve, because we may like the look of a technology but haven't yet persuaded a client to try it out - and until we do that blip cannot pass into Trial.

For the Adopt ring, we only include items when we think it would be a poor and potentially irresponsible choice not to use them given the appropriate project context.
